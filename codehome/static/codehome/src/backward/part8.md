## Bit Operation

In the C programming language, operations can be performed on a bit level using bitwise operators. Bitwise operations are contrasted by byte-level operations which characterize the bitwise operators' logical counterparts, the AND, OR and NOT operators. Instead of performing on individual bits, byte-level operators perform on strings of eight bits (known as bytes) at a time. The reason for this is that a byte is normally the smallest unit of addressable memory.

### Shift Operation

```c
// syntax for assembly language
[shift instruction] (register), imm
```

Shift instructions are summarized as follows,

| Operation | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| SHL | logic shift left |
| SHR | logic shift right, 0 extension |
| SAL | arithmetic shift left |
| SAR | arithmetic shift right, sign extension |
| ROL | rotate left without carry |
| ROR | rotate right without carry |

The most/least significant bit will be stored into `CF` for left shift and right shift respectively. But there are two special instructions,

| Operation | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| RCL | rotate left with carry |
| RCR | rotate right with carry |

Compared with `ROL` and `ROR`, it rotates with carry.

```bash
# rotate without carry
 ____       __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
|_CF_| <-- |__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__| <---|
        |---------->---------------------|

# rotate with carry
 ____       __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
|_CF_| <-- |__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__| <---|
  |---------------->---------------------|
```

### C Bit Operation

| Operation | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| AND | `x & y`, 1101 & 1001 == 1001 |
| OR  | `x | y`, 1101 & 1001 == 1101 |
| NOT | `!x`, !1101 == 0010 |
| XOR | `x ^ y`, 1101 ^ 1001 == 0100 |

### C Shift Operation

```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // 0000 0000 0000 1000
    int i = 8;
    unsigned int ui = 8;

    // signed
    printf("%x\n", i << 1);
    printf("%x\n", i >> 1);
    // unsigned
    printf("%x\n", ui << 1);
    printf("%x\n", ui >> 1);

    return 0;
}
```

```c
// signed
8:        printf("%x\n", i << 1);
00401036 8B 45 FC             mov         eax,dword ptr [ebp-4]
00401039 D1 E0                shl         eax,1
0040103B 50                   push        eax
0040103C 68 1C 20 42 00       push        offset string "%x\n" (0042201c)
00401041 E8 7A 00 00 00       call        printf (004010c0)
00401046 83 C4 08             add         esp,8
9:        printf("%x\n", i >> 1);
00401049 8B 4D FC             mov         ecx,dword ptr [ebp-4]
// only effect in right shift
0040104C D1 F9                sar         ecx,1
0040104E 51                   push        ecx
0040104F 68 1C 20 42 00       push        offset string "%x\n" (0042201c)
00401054 E8 67 00 00 00       call        printf (004010c0)
00401059 83 C4 08             add         esp,8
10:       // unsigned
11:       printf("%x\n", ui << 1);
0040105C 8B 55 F8             mov         edx,dword ptr [ebp-8]
0040105F D1 E2                shl         edx,1
00401061 52                   push        edx
00401062 68 1C 20 42 00       push        offset string "%x\n" (0042201c)
00401067 E8 54 00 00 00       call        printf (004010c0)
0040106C 83 C4 08             add         esp,8
12:       printf("%x\n", ui >> 1);
0040106F 8B 45 F8             mov         eax,dword ptr [ebp-8]
00401072 D1 E8                shr         eax,1
00401074 50                   push        eax
00401075 68 1C 20 42 00       push        offset string "%x\n" (0042201c)
0040107A E8 41 00 00 00       call        printf (004010c0)
0040107F 83 C4 08             add         esp,8
```

Notice that there is no difference in left shift between signed and unsigned data.

## Header in C

Before we talk about header file, we will introduce macro definition (`#define`) first.

### Macro

The first question is how a program run?

```c
foo.c  -->  replace macro (#define) -->  compile (0x21)  --> link (header files) -->  executable binary file (.exe)
```

```c
// macro without arguments
#define TRUE 1
#define FALSE 0
#define PI 3.141592
#define DEBUG 1

// macro with arguments, arguments must enclosed by parentheses
#define MAX(A, B) ((A) > (B) ? (A) : (B))
#define MALLOC(n, type) ((type*)malloc((n) * sizeof(type)))
```

What's the advantages of making `MAX` as macro instead of a function? From the point of assembler, there is no need to allocate memory for a function call.

### Header File

A header file is a file with extension `.h` which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.

```c
// foo.h
void foo();

// foo.c
void foo() {
  // statement;
}
```

```c
// main.c
#include "foo.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    foo();

    return 0;
}
```

PROBLEM: there is a scenario where a header file could be included repeatedly. How to fix it?

```c
#if !defined(filename_header)
#define filename_header

// if the version of microsoft compiler is greater than 1000, than use '#pragma once'
#if _MSC_VER > 1000
#pragma once
#endif

#endif
```

## Dynamic Memory

Since C is a structured language, it has some fixed rules for programming. One of it includes changing the size of an array. An array is collection of items stored at continuous memory locations.

```bash
 ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___
|_1_|_2_|_4_|_8_|_1_|_2_|_4_|_8_|_1_|
  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
```

As it can be seen that the length (size) of the array above made is 9. But what if there is a requirement to change this length (size). What should we do? Then we have to resort to dynamic memory allocation. Notice that dynamic memory is in **heap space** of virtual memory.

### Allocation

REQUIRED, `<sdtlib.h>` and `<malloc.h>`

- `malloc`
`malloc` is used to allocate memory blocks.

```c
// typedef unsigned int size_t
void *malloc( size_t size );
```

```c
// allocate 4 int for ptr
int* ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * 4);
```

### Initialization

- `memset`
`memset` sets buffers to a specified character.

```c
void *memset(void *str, int c, size_t n)
```

```c
// initialization
memset(ptr, 0, sizeof(int) * 4);
```

### Free

- `free`
`free` is used to deallocate or frees a memory block.

```c
void free( void *memblock );
```

```c
free(ptr);
ptr = NULL;
```

## File Operation

### Open and Close

- `fopen`
Each of these functions returns a pointer to the open file. A null pointer value indicates an error. 

| Mode | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| r | Opens for reading. If the file does not exist or cannot be found, the `fopen` call fails. |
| w | Opens an empty file for writing. If the given file exists, its contents are destroyed. |
| a | Opens for writing at the end of the file (appending) WITHOUT removing the EOF marker before writing new data to the file; creates the file first if it doesnâ€™t exist. |
| r+ | Opens for both reading and writing. (The file must exist) |
| w+ | Opens an empty file for both reading and writing. If the given file exists, its contents are destroyed. |
| a+ | Opens for reading and appending; the appending operation includes the removal of the EOF marker before new data is written to the file and the EOF marker is restored after writing is complete |

- `fclose`
fclose returns 0 if the stream is successfully closed. _fcloseall returns the total number of streams closed. Both functions return EOF to indicate an error.

```c
#include "stdio.h"

FILE *stream;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int numclosed = 0;

    // open for read
    if ( (stream = fopen("data", "r")) == NULL ) {
        printf("The file 'data' was not found.\n");
    }
    else {
        printf("The file 'data' was opened.\n");
    }

    // open for write
    if ( (stream = fopen("data", "w+")) == NULL ) {
        printf("The file 'data' was not found.\n");
    }
    else {
        printf("The file 'data' was opened.\n");
    }

    // close file
    // noting the return rule of 'fclose'
    if ( fclose(stream) ) {
        printf("The file 'data' was not closed\n");
    }

    // close all other files
    numclosed = _fcloseall();
    printf("Number of files closed by _fcloseall: %u\n", numclosed);
}
```

### Search

- `fseek`
If successful, fseek returns 0. Otherwise, it returns a nonzero value. On devices incapable of seeking, the return value is undefined.

```c
int fseek( FILE *stream, long offset, int origin );
```

| Builtin Para. | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| SEEK_CUR | current position of file pointer |
| SEEK_END | end of file |
| SEEK_SET | beginning of file |

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
   FILE *stream;
   char line[81];
   int  result;

   stream = fopen( "fseek.out", "w+" );
   if( stream == NULL )
      printf( "The file fseek.out was not opened\n" );
   else {
      fprintf( stream, "The fseek begins here: "
                       "This is the file 'fseek.out'.\n" );
      // L means 'long'
      result = fseek( stream, 23L, SEEK_SET);
      if ( result )
         perror( "Fseek failed" );
      else {
         printf( "File pointer is set to middle of first line.\n" );
         fgets( line, 80, stream );
         printf( "%s", line );
      }
      fclose( stream );
   }
}
```

### Print

- `fprintf` or `fwprintf`
`fprintf` returns the number of bytes written. `fwprintf` returns the number of wide characters written. Each of these functions returns a **negative value** instead when an output error occurs. 

```c
int fprintf( FILE *stream, const char *format [, argument ]...);
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <process.h>

FILE *stream;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int    i = 10;
    double fp = 1.5;
    char   s[] = "this is a string";
    char   c = '\n';

    stream = fopen( "fprintf.out", "w" );
    fprintf( stream, "%s%c", s, c );
    fprintf( stream, "%d\n", i );
    fprintf( stream, "%f\n", fp );
    fclose( stream );
    system( "type fprintf.out" );

    return 0;
}
```

```c
// Output:
this is a string
10
1.500000
```

### Position

- `ftell`
`ftell` is used to get the current position of a file pointer.

```c
long ftell( FILE *stream );
```

ftell returns the current file position. The value returned by ftell may not reflect the physical byte offset for streams opened in text mode, because text mode causes carriage returnâ€“linefeed translation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

FILE *stream;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    long position;
    char list[100];
    if( (stream = fopen( "ftell.c", "rb" )) != NULL ) {
        /* Move the pointer by reading data: */
        fread( list, sizeof( char ), 100, stream );
        /* Get position after read: */
        position = ftell( stream );
        printf( "Position after trying to read 100 bytes: %ld\n",
                position );
        fclose( stream );
    }
}
```

```c
// Output:
Position after trying to read 100 bytes: 100
```

### Get

- `fgetc`
`fgetc` is used to read a character from a stream, which returns the character read as an int or return EOF to indicate an error or end of file.

```c
int fgetc( FILE *stream );
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    FILE *stream;
    char buffer[81];
    int  i, ch;

    /* Open file to read line from: */
    if( (stream = fopen( "fgetc.c", "r" )) == NULL ) {
        exit( 0 );
    }

    /* Read in first 80 characters and place them in "buffer": */
    ch = fgetc(stream);
    for (i = 0; (i < 80) && (feof(stream) == 0); i++) {
        buffer[i] = (char)ch;
        ch = fgetc( stream );
    }

    /* Add null to end string */
    buffer[i] = '\0';
    printf( "%s\n", buffer );
    fclose( stream );
}
```

- `fgets`
`fgets` is used to get a string from a stream, which returns string. NULL is returned to indicate an error or an end-of-file condition. Use `feof` or `ferror` to determine whether an error occurred.

BTW, `feof` function returns a nonzero value after the first read operation that attempts to read past the end of the file. It returns 0 if the current position is not end of file. There is no error return.

```c
char *fgets( char *string, int n, FILE *stream );
```

```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
   FILE *stream;
   char line[100];

   if( (stream = fopen( "fgets.c", "r" )) != NULL ) {
      if ( fgets( line, 100, stream ) == NULL)
         printf( "fgets error\n" );
      else
         printf( "%s", line );
      fclose( stream );
   }
}
```

### Example

Here we are going to read a file into memory.

```markdown
<!-- data.txt -->
123 123 123 123 123

<!-- binary code -->
            +0 +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +9 +A +B +C +D +E +F
0x00000000: 31 32 33 20 31 32 33 20 31 32 33 20 31 32 33 20 
0x00000010: 31 32 33

file size: 19 Bytes
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define INT_T unsigned int
#define nullptr NULL

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    FILE *stream;
	INT_T filesize = 0;
	char* file = nullptr;
	int i, ch;
	
	if ((stream = fopen("data.txt", "r")) != NULL) {
		// get file size
		fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_END);
		filesize = ftell(stream);
		// reset stream pointer
		fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET);

		// memory allocation and initialization
		file = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char) * filesize + 1);
		memset(file, 0, sizeof(char) * filesize + 1);

		// read stream to file
		ch = fgetc(stream);
		for (i = 0; (i < filesize); i++) {
			file[i] = (char)ch;
			ch = fgetc(stream);
		}
		file[filesize] = '\0';

		printf("Filesize: %d\n", filesize);
		printf("Length: %d\n", i);
		printf("%s\n", file);
	}
	else {
		printf("ERROR: The file was not opened properly.");
	}
}
```
